NAME

    counts - Mifos front-end lines-of-code report

SYNOPSIS

    make

DESCRIPTION

    Generates a report of historical Struts/JSP, SpringMVC/FTL lines of code.

    WARNING: destroys any local modifications not committed to git!

    To generate the report, type "make". The path to your Mifos "head" clone
    will probably need to be manually changed in counts.sh.

    Prerequisites include: bash, make, gnuplot, and python.

NOTES

    Before June 2005, only a few Freemarker pages were used (for acceptance
    tests).

TODO

    * Add discrete "completion points" to the graph (ie: when a particular area
      is fully refactored).
